lainnya: Clara The Unbound, Clara The Judge
### Story
Clara is the Chosen One's Saintess.  
  
She calls Veronica Arch priestess and older sister, while following her faithfully. The close relationship and religious life they share serves as an example for other ordinary followers. however, the true nature of their relationship is complete master and servant. Clara only acts under Veronica's orders. Clara's consciousness has completely disintegrated for unknown reasons. Her only joy and meaning in life now is to follow Veronica's will and serve the Chosen One.  
  
Clara is the Chosen One's Saintess and 'Weapon'. She's at the head of missionary activities. These activities involve delivering judgement upon those who go against the Chosen One's will. Once Veronica gives the order, Clara uses her power from an unknown origin to punish the nonbelievers. Clara sometimes gets consumed by madness and loses control. This results in her indiscriminately dealing great damage to both friend and foe. However, Veronica doesn't mind any of this, and calls it the 'miracle of the Chosen One'. Therefore, Clara is secretly treated like a ticking time bomb by the others.  
Of course, there are those who worship this power. There will always be admirers of an enormous power, especially when people are losing hope from an outside force's invasion. Clara's activities under the name of Saintess have left a deep impression on many. It also reminded them of the forgotten memories of the Saintess who existed 500 years ago. And converted many into the Chosen One. Many neighboring nations, and other organizations that haven't lost bureaucratic capabilities are weary of the Chosen One's expansion. However, the fear of the Saintess' power is stopping them from taking measures.  
  
Opinions about Clara's first public and official appearance differ, but most agree that she came after the Chosen One's 3rd expedition. The expedition involved Veronica and her direct disciples traveling to the edge of the continent in search of the Chosen One's traces. The followers consider it as one of the riskiest since the Chosen One's founding, and one that placed the organization's existence on the line. There was an enormous explosion that could have wiped the area clean off the map during the expedition. But, only Veronica and an unknown female disciple led by her hand returned from the gruesome scene. Since that day, faint screaming resembling someone being horrifically tortured can be heard from the depths of the Chosen One's temple. Some can sense excessive amounts of regeneration magic coming from Clara, but no on e dares to question if there's a correlation between the two.
